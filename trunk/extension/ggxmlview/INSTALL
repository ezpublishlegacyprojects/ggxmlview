XML View extension for eZ publish INSTALL

Requirements
============
See the README files


Getting eZ publish
==================


Installing the "XML View extension for eZ publish" extension
==========================================================
1. Download the package.
2. Copy the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your
   eZ publish installation.
3. Unpack the files in the distribution.
4. Enable the extension in eZ publish.
5. The XSD definition generated by eZPublish content classes is not available by
   default to anonmyous access because of security concerns. To display it
   correctly you need to be logged in or give it access to the anonymous user
   (in the admin interface, "roles and permissions" tab)
6. By default the xml and json views are not cached, which could mean unacceptable performance.
   To enable view cache, uncomment the appropriate line in extension/ggxmlview/settings/site.ini.append.php

Testing that it works
=====================
Point your browser to http://ezpublish.install/index.php/layout/set/xml/content/view/xml/2
or http://ezpublish.install/index.php/layout/set/json/content/view/json/2
or http://ezpublish.install/index.php/xml/xsd
(please not that the first 2 of these will take quite a long time to generate,
you might want to test on a node that does not have a big subtree)
