XML View extension for eZ publish INSTALL

Requirements
============
See the README files


Getting eZ publish
==================


Installing the "XML View extension for eZ publish" extension
==========================================================
1. Download the package.
2. Copy the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your
   eZ publish installation.
3. Unpack the files in the distribution.
4. Enable the extension in eZ publish.
5. The XSD definition generated by eZPublish content classes is not available by
   default to anonmyous access because of security concerns. To display it
   correctly you need to be logged in or give it access to the anonymous user
   (in the admin interface, "roles and permissions" tab)
6. By default the xml and json views are not cached, which could mean unacceptable performance.
   To enable view cache, uncomment the appropriate lines in extension/ggxmlview/settings/site.ini.append.php
7. the easiest way to have the xml and json views displayed using "nice urls" is
   to create url aliases that point to the system url of those views, eg:
   /sitemapxml => /layout/set/xml/content/view/xmlmap/2
   Pelase refer to the online eZ Publish documentation for details on creating url aliases.


Testing that it works
=====================
Point your browser to http://my.ezpublish.site/siteaccess/index.php/layout/set/xml/content/view/xml/2
or http://my.ezpublish.site/siteaccess/index.php/layout/set/json/content/view/json/2
or http://my.ezpublish.site/siteaccess/index.php/xml/xsd
or http://my.ezpublish.site/siteaccess/index.php/layout/set/xml/content/view/xmlmap/2
or http://my.ezpublish.site/siteaccess/index.php/layout/set/json/content/view/jsonmap/2

(please not that the last 2 of these will take quite a long time to generate,
you might want to test on a node that does not have a big subtree of content)
